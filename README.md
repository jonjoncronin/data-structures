# data-structures repo
### Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the README for the data-structures repo.
This repo is intended to be used as a dumping ground where myself and choice
collaborators can re-familarize ourselves with certain data structures and how
to implement them in the C programming language.
