# linkedList library
### Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the README for the linkedList library.

This library is currently very simple and generic. You can -
1. Create a list with a max size
2. Delete a list
3. Add a generic node to the head
4. Add a generic node to the tail
5. Remove a generic node
6. Query the max size
7. Get the current length or count of entries it is storing
8. Query whether or not the list already has a node with the same data as a
    specified node.
